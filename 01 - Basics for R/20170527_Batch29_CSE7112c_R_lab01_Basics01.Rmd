Tools
========================================================
*  You will be mainly using following Open-Source softwares in the course:
    - R 
        - Base R
        - R Studio
        - R Markdown
    - Python
        - Spyder
        - Jupyter Notebook
    - Github

Python
========================================================
* History 
    - Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, a dutch programmer, in 1989.
    - He is known as 'Benevolent Dictator For Life'  (BDFL) in Python community
* Applications
    - Scientific computations
    - Big Data & Analytics
    - Web and GUI Development
    - Many more!
    
Python IDEs 
========================================================
  - Spyder is one of the popular IDEs which provide running python script through desktop interface
  - The Jupyter Notebook provides interactive computing environment that enables users to author documents containing code as well as rich text format

Git & GitHub
========================================================      
  - Git is a distributed control system (DVCS) for tracking changes in computer files and collabortaing on those files with your team.
  - GitHub is hosting service for your repositories which can be version controlled via Git.

About R
========================================================
class: footer

* Derived from '**S**' language and developed by **R**os Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman in 1992 
* Free software environment for statistical computing, data analytics and scientific research.
* Advanced capabilities like R-Notebooks, R-Presentation and Web Shiny Apps (This presentation is made in R!)



R Studio
========================================================

* Integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
* Available in open source and commercial editions 
* Runs on 
  - The desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or 
  - In a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro
  



Working with R 
========================================================

R Environment
========================================================
* Environment can be thought as bag of names
* Environment name points to an object stored elsewhere in memory
* The objects do not live in the environment so multiple names can point to the same object

Three special Environments
========================================================
* Global Environment
    - This is the environment in which you normally work. 
    - The parent of the global environment is the last package that you attached with library() or require().
* Base environment
    - Is the environment of the base package. Its parent is the empty environment.
* Empty environment
    - Is the ultimate ancestor of all environments, and the only environment without a parent.

Atomic Objects
========================================================
* Character
* Numeric (real numbers)
* Integer
* Complex
* Logical (True/False)



Evaluation and Printing
========================================================
- The "<-"  Or "="  symbols works as the assignment operator.


```{r}
x <- 5 	## nothing printed
x # Auto printing
print(x) # Explicit printing

x = 6 	## nothing printed
x # Auto printing
print(x) # Explicit printing
```
* The [1] indicates the x is a vector and 5 is the first element in that vector


Series
========================================================
* The ":" operator is used to create integer Sequences

```{r}
x = 1:20
x
```


Vectors
========================================================
* The most basic object is a vector
    - A vector can only contain objects of the same class with exception of list which can contain objects of several classes
* vectors can be created with 'The vector()' function. 

```{r}
vector(mode='integer',length=6)
vector(mode='logical',length=6)
```

Creating Vectors
========================================================
Use `c()` function
```{r}
x1=c(0.5,0.6)
x2=c(TRUE,FALSE) 
x3=c(T,F)
x4=c('alpha','beta','gamma')
x5=9:29 
x6=c(1+2i,2+4i)

```

Matrices
========================================================
* Matrices are vectors with dimension attributes
* Dimension attribute is itself and integer vector of length 2
```{r}
v=vector(mode='integer',length=6)
m=matrix(data=v,nrow=2,ncol=3)
m
dim(m)
attributes(m)
```

Matrices
========================================================
* Matrices are constructed column-wise.
```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m
```

cbind-ing and rbind-ing
========================================================
* Matrices can be created by column-binding or row-binding with cbind() and rbind().
```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
cbind(x, y)
rbind(x, y)
```

Data Frames
========================================================
* Data frames are used to store tabular data.
  - Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column; matrices must have every element be the same class.
```{r}
x <- data.frame(Cid = 1:4, Purchase = c(T, T, F, F))
x
nrow(x)
ncol(x)
```

Reading Data
========================================================
* There are a few principal functions reading data into R.
  - read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data
  - readLines, for reading lines of a text file
  - source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
  - load, for reading in saved workspaces

Reading Data
========================================================
```{r}
data <- read.csv("data.csv",sep = ",")
data
dim(data)
```
